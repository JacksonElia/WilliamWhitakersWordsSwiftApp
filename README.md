# William Whitaker's Words Swift App
My own take at a William Whitakers Latin Translation app that utilizes some basic web scrapping and html parsing. I made this app to refamiliarize myself with Swift.

# Motivation
I made this app because I am a Latin student and I was unsatisfied with the app made for William Whitaker's Words on IOS. Also, I saw it as a good opportunity for me to relearn Swift as I was very rusty.
